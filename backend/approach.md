### redis hashmaps
- game:
  - id
  - hostId
  - playerId: array of playerIds
  - status: waiting, playing, starting, finished
  - createdAt
- player:
  - id
  - name
  - currentGameId
  - gamesPlayed:
    - id
    - position
    - wpm
    - accuracy
    - time
- gameResults:
 - gameId
 - players
  - id
  - position
  - wpm
  - accuracy
  - time

### Workflow
- [X] *user visits the frontend*: server gets a connection request, if it gets a userid, check for existing user, send back the past games if this is an existing user, if he was part of a game in the waiting/starting state, get him in sync, if the game is already being played, let the new user spectate. or else create a player instance, store it in the redis and send back the playerId
- [X] *user creates a game*: initialize the game object, store in redis, update the gameId of the player object and send back the gameId. Listen to that game:gameid and broadcast the changes. the changes will have an event and a payload with the info required to be shared.
- [X] *user joins a game*: validate the max room size, update the game object, and the player object send back the players state i.e. their ids and names, consdiering the current new user, publish the new userid and name to others and subscribe to the gam for further updates.
- [X] *user changes name*: update the player object, publish the new name and user id to the gameRoom.
- [X] *starts the game*: validate the min room size, update the state of the gameRoom, start the countdown and broadcast it, then change the state of the room again to `playing`.
- [X] *update the positions*: the frontend sends in the wpm, position and accuracy. the server publishes the positions to the gameRoom.
- [X] *a user finishes the race*: calculate the final wpm, position and accuracy, store in the game results, update the player object with his stats.
- [X] *all the users finish the race*: when the roomSize is equal to the size of the gameResults players, this means that the race is over, change the status of the room to finished, publish the game results by sending in the gameResults object. what if the user refreshes on the results page? how will he see the results again?
- [ ] *hitting on restart the game*: how will this be implemented?
- [ ] *ending the game*: clears the game object from the redis store.
- [ ] *the home page will show the past races of the user if this is an old one*: fetch data from the player object and show the past races, positions, etc.

# Feedback on Your Multiplayer Typing Game Approach

Your approach to building a multiplayer typing game with Express, WebSockets, and Redis looks solid overall. Here's my analysis of the existing approach and some gaps that need to be addressed:

## Gaps and Improvements

### 1. Missing Implementation Details

- **Restart the game (point 9)**: You should implement this by:
  - Adding a "restart" flag in the game object
  - When host clicks restart, broadcast a restart event to all players
  - Create a new game instance with the same players
  - Clear the previous game results and reset player states
  - Update playerIds with only those who opt to join the new game

- **Results page refresh (point 8)**:
  - Store game results separately with a longer TTL
  - When user refreshes on results page, check if their ID exists in the gameResults
  - Serve cached results if the game has already finished

### 2. Error Handling

- Add handling for disconnections during gameplay
- Implement timeout mechanisms for players who stop participating
- Add validation for all incoming data from clients

### 3. Data Management

- Set appropriate TTL (Time-To-Live) for Redis keys to prevent memory bloat
- Add database persistence for long-term storage of game history
- Consider periodic cleanup of abandoned games

### 4. Additional Features

- **Spectator mode**: Allow users to observe ongoing games
  - Create a separate channel for spectators
  - Send game updates without allowing interaction

- **Game invites**: Allow players to invite others via shareable links
  - Generate unique invite codes
  - Store pending invites with expiration

### 5. Performance Considerations

- Implement rate limiting for player updates to prevent flooding
- Consider batching position updates to reduce network overhead
- Use Redis pub/sub efficiently by minimizing payload sizes

## Alternative/Better Approaches

### 1. Data Structure Refinements

Consider normalizing your Redis structure:
```
game:{id}:info -> hash of game metadata
game:{id}:players -> set of player IDs
game:{id}:results -> sorted set of results by position
player:{id} -> hash of player data
player:{id}:games -> sorted set of game IDs by time
```

This approach allows better scalability and easier querying.

### 2. State Management

Consider implementing a more formal state machine for games:
```
CREATED → WAITING → STARTING → PLAYING → FINISHING → FINISHED
```

Each state transition would have validation rules and specific allowed actions.

### 3. Backend Architecture

Consider separating your WebSocket handling from your game logic:
- Socket server handles connections/disconnections
- Game service manages game state
- Player service manages player data
- Results service manages game results

This separation of concerns will make your code more maintainable.

### 4. Offline Support

Add reconnection handling to gracefully manage:
- Browser refresh during game
- Temporary network disconnections
- Device switching

### 5. Real-time Performance

For large-scale deployment:
- Consider using Redis Streams instead of pub/sub for better reliability
- Implement sharding strategy if planning to support many concurrent games
- Add monitoring for WebSocket connections and Redis performance

Overall, your approach is well thought out. Adding these refinements will make your game more robust, scalable, and provide a better user experience.
